        <ol>
            <li><strong>Outer Wilds</strong>-Outer Wilds is just... insane. A strange sci-fi mystery to be uncovered,
                Outer Wilds is set in a living breathing solar system that's simultaneously small, but also tremendous
                in its ambition and execution, It's a game packed with jaw-dropping moments that feel organic in a way
                few games can compete with. I cannot emphasize this enough: play this video game.</li>
            <li><strong>A Short Hike-</strong>-Does exactly what it says on the tin. A short, beautiful video game that
                I wish more people would play.</li>
            <li><strong>Journey</strong>-A game that is so beautiful, so simple, and so impactful that it has become a
                staple of the medium. Journey is a game that everyone should play at least once in their life.</li>
            <li><strong>Hotline Miami</strong>-Savage, weird, brutal, original -- Hotline Miami also plays host to one
                of the coolest video game soundtracks ever compiled, so you can feel stylish as you set about a house
                full of mobsters with a mask and a samurai sword.</li>
            <li><strong>Braid</strong>-Braid is smart, unique and -- if you switch your brain on -- can be finished in a
                single evening. Be warned though, you'll most likely find yourself on YouTube frantically searching for
                solutions to some of these puzzles.</li>
            <li><strong>Portal</strong>-We all know how good Portal is, but here's what we all kinda forget: The
                original was perfectly concise. If you haven't played it, you can barrel through in a handful of hours.
                You absolutely should do that.</li>
            <li><strong>Oxenfree</strong>-Not enough people have played Oxenfree. That's a shame. It's got brilliant,
                not just good-for-a-video-game writing and you could easily get through the game in a single sitting.
                Pick this one up next time it's on sale.</li>
            <li><strong>Firewatch</strong>-Firewatch reminds me of Oxenfree because it's well written, but, again, not
                in that "pretty good for a video game" kinda way. It's just flat-out good and interesting. It's a game
                about loneliness really, and it's truly insightful all the way through to its false ending. Firewatch
                rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Inside</strong>-Inside is savage. It's also interesting, thought provoking, atmospheric and
                seamlessly designed. It also has the best ending of any video game ever. If David Lynch made video
                games, he might have made Inside. </li>
            <li><strong>Gorogoa</strong>-Gorogoa is unlike any video game you've ever played.

                It's a puzzle game... I guess. But it's really a game about exploring a strange universe in ways you
                can't really predict.

                Find a way to play this game.</li>
