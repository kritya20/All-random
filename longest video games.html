        <h2> <strong>Longest</strong> video games <small>(According to beat time and there are more long games)</small>
        </h2>
        <p>Note: To be considered for the list, a game must have at least ten main story times submitted to
            HowLongToBeat and something resembling an ending.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Crusader Kings 3-75 Hours</strong>-Crusader Kings 3 is a strategy game about rulers and their
                land. You play as one of those rulers, and you have to manage and build your kingdom through different
                generations. Or at least, you play as them as long as they're alive. Once they perish, you continue as
                one of your heirs,You can start in 867, 1066, or 1178, and the game comes to a true conclusion in 1453.
                So, you have a lot of years to build up your empire. This is why it takes 75 hours to beat.</li>
            <li><strong>Record Of Agarest War-75.5 Hours</strong>-Record of Agarest War is a game that needed to have a
                fairly long story. This is because it tells a tale of a war between good and evil that lasts
                generations. These generations are actually featured in the game itself,After set points in the
                narrative, you jump forward to the next generation of warriors. This wouldn't have really had the same
                impact if the game only lasted a few hours. It's supposed to feel like you're engaged in a lengthy war.
                Your character's role in the conflict is complex, as you can follow the light or dark path. Along the
                way, you participate in many turn-based battles.</li>
            <li><strong>Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate-76 Hours</strong>-Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is all about going on
                different quests and slaying various beasts. These creatures are called monsters for a reason since
                they’re very dangerous. At least, they’re dangerous to the average shmuck who faces off against
                them,Yet, it wouldn’t be much of a Monster Hunter game if you were just prey. You have the capability to
                stand up to these beasts and take them out. Getting all of the main ones, though, will take significant
                time since this is a 76-hour game.</li>
            <li><strong>Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate-76.5 Hours </strong>-The original Monster Hunter 4 was only released
                in Japan, but a few months later, the Ultimate version came out. This allowed North Americans and
                Europeans to experience this lengthy action RPG,The game is about fighting large monsters, but there is
                a bit more to it than that. You get to explore detailed environments, acquire resources, and track your
                large target. These things can take a bit of time, so it isn’t surprising that the game takes as long as
                76.5 hours to complete, especially as some of the toughest beasts take a long time to beat.</li>
            <li><strong>Pathfinder: Kingmaker-77 Hours</strong>-Pathfinder: Kingmaker is based on the Pathfinder
                tabletop RPG series. As those games tend to be long, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that a
                video game version eats up a lot of hours, too. During that time, you will be experiencing an isometric
                RPG that features both real-time and turn-based combat,Outside of fights, you can spend time building up
                your kingdom. Well, technically, it's not really a kingdom at first. It's just a piece of land. But you
                can make it into a kingdom over the course of the game. You do this by creating buildings and assigning
                important roles to people. All of this can take some time, which is one of the reasons the game is long.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Valheim-79.5 Hours</strong>-Survival sandbox games like Valheim don't generally have endings.
                After all, they're just usually about surviving in an open world for as long as you can or want. Yet,
                Valheim is different from traditional survival titles,You are controlling a Viking attempting to prove
                himself worthy of entering Valhalla. If you know about Norse Mythology, you will know that those who
                reach Valhalla are brave warriors. Therefore, you must prove yourself in that regard, too, by defeating
                the six bosses in the game. They're no slouches, and you start with nothing, so it takes a while to
                achieve those six victories.</li>
            <li><strong>Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate-78 Hours</strong>-Monster Hunter Generations is a spin-off
                to the main Monster Hunter series. Yet, despite being a spin-off, it's a lot like the mainline titles.
                This is because every mission tasks you with hunting large, dangerous beasts,The Ultimate version is an
                HD port for the Nintendo Switch, and it's even longer than the original title. You need around 78 hours
                to finish all the main quests in this version.</li>
            <li><strong>Dragon Quest 7: Fragments Of The Forgotten Past-78 Hours</strong>-Dragon Quest 7 is a turn-based
                JRPG with a story that revolves around an island. It's named Estard and is thought to be the only bit of
                landmass around. However, the hero of the story finds evidence of the existence of some surrounding
                islands,This leads to a long, colorful adventure involving time travel. You go to different places in
                the past to learn a lot about the missing islands. So, you explore plenty of distinct places throughout
                the story, which is why it takes such a long time to beat.</li>
            <li><strong>RollerCoaster Tycoon 2-78.5 Hours</strong>-RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is a management simulation
                game that you can play for as long as you desire. You are free to build the most impressive and
                lucrative theme park possible. However, that doesn't mean you can't complete the game in a sense,There
                are a host of different scenarios that place you in a unique park and give you an objective to complete.
                Finishing them all takes about 78.5 hours. This hefty playtime is due to how long some of the more
                difficult scenarios take to beat.</li>
            <li>The longest video games, considering overall playtime, are idle/incremental games like <strong>Melvor
                    Idle</strong>,
                which can take thousands of hours. When considering story length specifically, <strong>Persona 5
                    Royal</strong> is often cited as the longest, taking around 101 hours to complete the main story
